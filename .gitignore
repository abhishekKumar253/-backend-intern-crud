# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written to the pyinstaller/build/ folder, but in some cases they may be
#  created alongside the source code.
#  Remove these files to ensure that the directory is clean and can be committed.
#  https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Usage-of-PyInstaller#what-files-does-pyinstaller-create
#  When pyinstaller is run, it creates the following files:
#  - *.spec - The spec file is a plain text file that contains the instructions for the build.
#  - *.pyinstaller - The build directory contains all of the intermediate files created during the build.
#  - * - The build directory is named after the application's main script file.
